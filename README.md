# schoolProject24
This is a school project inspired by Robocode. It will only be used to get good grades in school.

RoboCode is a java game, with the goal in mind to code a tank to fight against other tanks in a battle arena. 
The Battles happen in real-time.
The player will not have any influence on the game once it starts, instead the player must code the behaviour of his AI to react to different kinds of events it's in battle.
