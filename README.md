# schoolProject24
This School Project will be about the game Snake.

The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food laying around the field. The player must avoid walls and it's own body.
This game is an adaptation to the classic snake game. 
It will include enemies that search for food too, if the snake touches an enemy it's body will shrink instead of a game over.
The game only ends when the snake shrinks until only it's head is visible or when it hits itself.


//info-dump
The Game instance will not be contained into a box but it will be a semi-open World with paths and food scattered about.
The snake will make it's way through the land, while avoiding enemies. 
The enemies will include flies that steal your food and bad snakes that will try to cut your path (it will not be possible to write all of that in a small time window but this is only a info-dump)
