# schoolProject24
This School Project will be about the game Snake.

The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food laying around the field. The player must avoid walls and it's own body.
This game is an adaptation to the classic snake game. 
It will include enemies that search for food too, if the snake touches an enemy it's body will shrink instead of a game over.
The game only ends when the snake shrinks until only it's head is visible or when it hits itself.
